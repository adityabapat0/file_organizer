# file_organizer

just a simple file organizer to keep my ocd under control. 

mainly targeted towards /downloads folder beacuse it is always messy but it can be focused on different folders by changing its directory.

built it under two hours so a alot of shit code and no debugging wiith very few extentions.

libraries: os & shutil
